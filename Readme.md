# How to: Make the FilterByText Action Search Within Required Properties


<p>This topic demonstrates how to customize the Filter by Text Action's behavior. This Action filters the current List View by setting criteria for its collection data source. According to the criteria, the object's properties must contain individual words from the word combination typed by an end-user. Reference several techniques on how to modify the Action's behavior, in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/DevExpressExpressAppSystemModuleFilterController_FullTextFilterActiontopic">FilterController.FullTextFilterAction</a> member description. Here, you'll see how to use one of these techniques. We'll specify a custom list of the properties that will be used to generate the filter criterion for the current List View.</p><p>See code in the MyFilterController.cs (MyFilterController.vb) file. For details, refer to the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument2923">How to: Make the FilterByText Action Search Within Required Properties</a>  topic in XAF documentation.</p>
